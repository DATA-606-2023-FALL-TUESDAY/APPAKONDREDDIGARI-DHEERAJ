## 2. Background
The New York City Motor Vehicle Collisions Analysis Project aims to provide valuable insights into motor vehicle collisions in New York City. This analysis is crucial for enhancing road safety and urban planning. The project seeks to answer questions such as the primary causes of collisions, high-risk areas, collision patterns over time, and the influence of weather and road conditions.

## 3. Data
- **Data Sources:** The dataset is sourced from the New York City Open Data platform.
- **Data Size:** []
- **Data Shape:** [3.7 million rows and 25 columns ]
- **Time Period:** [April 2016 to December 2021]
- **Each Row Represents:** A motor vehicle collision.
- **Data Dictionary:**
