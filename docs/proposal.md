## 2. Background
This dataset includes historical sales information for 45 establishments spread across several geographies. The aim is to project the sales for each department in each store, each of which has multiple departments. This can be achieved by using supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forests, and decision trees. This will allow us to use the data to predict future sales and identify the most important features that are influencing sales.
## 3. Data
- **Data Sources:** The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle platform.
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data
- **Data Size:** [4mb]
- **Data Shape:** [421570 rows and 16 columns ]
- **Time Period:** [February 2010 to December 2013]
- **Each Row Represents:** A sales history.
